THE SECRET POOL OF KUANG SI WATERFALL
January 11, 2016 / By NomadicMatt
Waterfalls at Kuang Si in Laos
<q>Do you want to join us to see the waterfalls tomorrow?</q>The girls across the table asked.
<q>Sure!</q>I replied.
And, just like that, I was heading off to Luang Prabang<q>s</q> famous Kuang Si waterfalls with three girls I met at dinner.
Walk around Luang Prabang for more than two seconds and dozens of tuk-tuk drivers will ask if you want to go to the waterfalls.
And they mean only one: Kuang Si.
In a town of not much to do (which is a blessing), it<q>s</q> the most popular attraction for travelers.
The waterfalls were listed in my guidebook as a <q>must-do,</q> and every traveler I spoke to before visiting the city told me I would be crazy not to see falls.
Normally, when so many people talk so enthusiastically about a place, I become skeptical. This is going to be a tourist trap, I think. It<q>s</q> going to be one of those beautiful places so overwhelmed by crowds jostling for the perfect selfie, I won<q>t</q> be able to escape for a moment of serenity.
But I love waterfalls immensely. They are incredibly soothing.
So after waking up early the next morning, I waited at the appropriate meeting spot for my new friends. As they were late, this gave me time to make arrangements with one of the many tuk-tuk drivers sitting around the main roundabout. One come up to me and we began our dance: we haggled, joked, threw up our arms in frustration, walked away, and then came to a price he feigned was too low and I knew was still slightly too high.
After my friends arrived, we boarded our shared taxi with a few other strangers and drove the hour outside town to the waterfalls. The air cooled as we passed through small, dusty towns, past schools where kids played and screamed outside, and beautiful Buddha statues, rice fields, and verdant mountains in the distance. It was my first real look at Laos since I landed the night before. There was a simple, unspoiled beauty to it.
After arriving and paying our 20,000 kip ($2.50 USD) entrance fee, we first stopped at the famous bear sanctuary. Asiatic black bears, or moon bears, are an endangered species, as their bile is used in Chinese medicine to <q>relieve internal heat</q> (it<q>s</q> also prescribed for anything from hangovers to cancer and is found in common bath products). This sanctuary rescues them and houses 23 bears that are now allowed to roam and enjoy life outside a cage. It made me want a bear. They were so cute and furry.
